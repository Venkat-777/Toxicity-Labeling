# Kaggle Toxicity-Labeling Project

This project, completed from July to September 2023, involved solving a Kaggle comment toxicity labeling problem using TensorFlow. I applied machine learning techniques, including BERT, sigmoid activation, and optimizers like AdamW and SGD. Throughout the project, I gained hands-on experience in sentiment analysis and model optimization, enhancing my skills in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Python.
